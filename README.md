# classify_cat-dog_with_CNN
A convolutional neural network, VGG, is used to extract features from cats and dogs images. The project is taught by Flare Zhao in his course, "Python 3 Intro to Artificial Intelligence".

A VGG model is trained on a set of cats and dogs images (without the fully connected layer). The output of the model is the features of all the images. The features are then later used in the fully connected layer, predictions were made on 9 testing data and results were visualized.
